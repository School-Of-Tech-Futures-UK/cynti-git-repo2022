Hello and welcome to my git repo with all my SoTF projects :)

**Clone: to do this copy the relevant SSH key of the folder or file you'd like to clone and git clone it using your CLI

**Build: These projects include an array (!) of methods that have allowed me to programmatically build and design them. Feel free to check out my code

**Run: to run any of these, you can either git clone or download the folder/files, and then run it via VS Code Liver Server to demo them

**Contribute: If you'd like to contribute then that would be great as I continue to improve my Javascript files with higher order functions and pure functions. This is an open source repo!

Happy coding!
