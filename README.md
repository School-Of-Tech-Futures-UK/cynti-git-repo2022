Hello and welcome to my git repo with all my SoTF projects :)

**Clone: to do this copy the relevant SSH key of the folder or file you'd like to clone and git clone it using your Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Build: These projects include an array (!) of methods that have allowed me to programmatically build and design them. Feel free to check out my code (it's  mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and package dependencies)

**Run: to run any of these, you can either git clone or download the folder/files, and then run it via VS Code Liver Server to demo them

(nb: for the Connect 4 game you will need to set up Insomnia GET request and a POST request to save the payload via the RESTful API, and you can run the server using node)

**Contribute: If you'd like to contribute then that would be great as I continue to improve my Javascript files with higher order functions and pure functions. This is an open source repo!

Happy coding!
